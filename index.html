            <div class="troubleshooting-tip">
                <h4>üîë Login Issues</h4>
                <p>If you're experiencing login problems, first verify that you're using the correct email address and password. Check for typos and ensure caps lock is not accidentally enabled. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try logging in again. If the problem persists, use the password recovery feature to reset your credentials.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="troubleshooting-tip">
                <h4>üìß Email Sending Problems</h4>
                <p>When emails aren't sending properly, check your internet connection and verify that the outgoing server settings are correct. Ensure your email client is properly configured with the correct SMTP settings. Large attachments may cause sending failures, so consider reducing file sizes or using cloud storage links instead.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="troubleshooting-tip">
                <h4>üì• Email Receiving Issues</h4>
                <p>If you're not receiving emails, check your spam or junk folder first. Verify that your inbox isn't full and that email filters aren't redirecting messages incorrectly. Review your email client's synchronization settings and ensure they're configured properly for your account type.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="troubleshooting-tip">
                <h4>üîß Technical Configuration</h4>
                <p>For advanced technical issues, verify that your email client is using the correct server settings. Check firewall and antivirus settings that might be blocking email access. Update your email client software to the latest version, as older versions may have compatibility issues with current server configurations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="troubleshooting-tip">
                <h4>üì± Mobile App Issues</h4>
